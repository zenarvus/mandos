# MaNDoS
Markdown Node Display Server

The source code for my Markdown previewer and personal website.

## Quick Start
### 1.0 Create HTML Template
- **1.1: Create a folder named `mandos` in your Markdown folder.**
    > `cd /path/to/markdown/folder && mkdir mandos`
- **1.2: Create a file named `main.html` within it. This will be the default template used for markdown files.**
    > You can include 5 variables in the template:
    > - `{{.Metadata}}` The metadata part of the file.
    > - `{{.File}}`: Markdown's file name.
    > - `{{.Title}}`: The last H1 heading of the Markdown file or the `title` in the document's metadata.
    > - `{{.Content}}`: The raw content of the Markdown file, excluding metadata.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > To convert raw {{.Content}} to html, use {{ToHtml .Content}}

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also use different templates for different Markdown files by specifying the template name in the `template` metadata field.

### 2.0 Create static Folder
You need to create a folder named `static` at the root of your Markdown folder.

`cd /path/to/markdown/folder && mkdir static`

- Files in this folder will **always** be served. This is where you should place your CSS and JavaScript files.
- Non-markdown files inside other directories are only served if they are linked in a public markdown file.

### 3.0 Run The Server
`MD_FOLDER=/path/to/markdown/folder INDEX=index.md ONLY_PUBLIC=yes TEMPLATES=/path/to/templates/folder go -C /path/to/mandos run .`

- `INDEX=index.md`: This file will be served at the root path of the URL.
- `ONLY_PUBLIC=yes`: This option serves only public notes and their non-Markdown attachments. A note is considered public if its `public` metadata field is `true`.
- `TEMPLATES=/path/to/templates/folder`: Use this to set a custom template folder if you do not want to use the default `mandos` one at the root of your Markdown folder.

> If you want to run the server with TLS encryption, you can use the `CERT` and `KEY` environment variables by passing certificate and key file locations to them.

## Special Endpoints
- `/rss`: This endpoint displays only time-aware nodes in RSS format. To make a Markdown node time-aware, include a `date` metadata field with a date value formatted as `yyyy-mm-dd`.
- `/node-list`: This endpoint shows which nodes are connected to each other. It allows you to create [cool graphs](http://zenarvus.com/graph.md) like the ones in Obsidian.
    > Example Format:
    > ```json
    > [{
    >     "file": "/1tvytN.md",
    >     "inlinks": [
    >         "/1tvytC.md"
    >     ],
    >     "outlinks": [
    >         "/1tvytC.md"
    >     ],
    >     "title": "Md-Agenda.Nvim Documentation"
    > },
    > {
    >     "file": "/1u0EI6.md",
    >     "inlinks": [
    >         "/1tvytC.md"
    >     ],
    >     "outlinks": [
    >         "/1tvytC.md"
    >     ],
    >     "title": "Md-Agenda Specification"
    > }]
    > ```

## Additional Tips
- Metadata field must be at the top of your markdown file. Its syntax is similar to Hugo's. Place fields inside `+++` for `toml` and `---` for `yaml` metadata.
- You can use JavaScript in your Markdown files. It's supported.
- All non-Markdown file links in a public node are also made public.

## Templates
The templates folder is just for viewing the wanted markdown content using the template files inside. Markdown files themselves cannot execute the golang template codes.

However,  ..dasdmakmdlas√∂dl

You can also use templates in non markdown files. They will be parsed. Though, markdown special variables like .Metadata or .Content are not available in them. Still, there are some cool functions you can use inside these files.
